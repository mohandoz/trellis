## Project

**Conjure** — the missing init kit for Claude Code. Scaffolds the four-layer
harness (`CLAUDE.md` + lazy **Skills** + isolated **Subagents** + deterministic
**Hooks**) in one command, for new and existing repos. Ships safe migrations, 9
stack profiles, 4 compliance overlays, graph integration, and an auditable CLI.
Open-source tool for teams where prompt-adherence and reproducibility matter.

**Core Value:** Turn any repo into a production-grade, eval-backed Claude Code
harness with one trustworthy command — and keep it healthy. If all else fails,
`conjure init` + `conjure audit` must reliably produce and verify a safe harness.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: POSIX bash + Node.js `.mjs` hooks — stay cross-platform; no heavy runtime deps.
- **Safety**: backup-before-mutate on every change; no `curl | sh` foot-guns; hooks `exit 2` (never `exit 1`).
- **Size caps**: CLAUDE.md ≤100 lines, SKILL.md ≤200, agent ≤80 — enforced by audit/CI.
- **Compatibility**: Claude Code ≥2.1.117; `@imports` forbidden in CLAUDE.md (eager-load foot-gun).
- **Quality gate**: every PR passes shellcheck, JSON Schema, frontmatter, size caps, and coverage checks.

## Technology Stack

Current milestone: **v0.3.0 — Testing + Telemetry**. Full prescriptive detail in
`.planning/research/STACK.md` (do not inline it here — it would breach the cap).

| Decision | Pick |
|----------|------|
| Fixture regression testing | Extend hand-rolled `tests/run.sh`; `bats-core` only at unit level. No shellspec, no npm test deps. |
| Skill-firing telemetry | Append-only JSONL via `PreToolUse`(`Skill`) + `InstructionsLoaded` hooks. Local-only, no service. |
| Cost estimator | chars/4 heuristic × dated price table baked into `conjure`. No bundled tokenizer; `--exact` opt-in only. |
| Cross-platform preflight | `command -v` table (bash) + mirrored `.mjs` probe; OS-detected install hints. |

Runtime envelope: bash + stdlib-`.mjs` + `jq` + `shellcheck`. Keep `dependencies: {}` empty.

## Architecture

Entrypoints in `cli/`, workers in `scripts/`, shared logic (new in v0.3.0) in `lib/`.
Profiles in `profiles/`, overlays in `compliance/`, fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`.
See `.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` for component boundaries and build order.

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
