# Failure Modes

What to do when something in the Conjure harness breaks. Symptoms → causes
→ fixes.

## graphify unavailable / down

**Symptom**: skill `code-graph` returns errors, queries fail.

**Causes**:
- graphify CLI not installed.
- `graphify-out/` missing (never ran `--mode deep`).
- Graph corrupt (partial write during crash).

**Fix**:
```bash
# Diagnose
which graphify
ls graphify-out/

# Reinstall if needed
uv tool install --force graphify

# Rebuild from scratch
rm -rf graphify-out/
conjure refresh-graph . --full
```

**Fallback while down**: Claude falls back to skill `repo-pack` or `ast-search`
or vanilla `Grep` (per `skills/code-graph/SKILL.md` fallback section).

## MCP server unreachable / slow

**Symptom**: skill descriptions reference MCP tools but they don't fire;
session start is slow.

**Causes**:
- Network down, npm registry slow, server crashed.
- API token expired (GitHub, context7 paid tier).
- MCP SDK version mismatch.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Test each server manually
npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --help
# Check logs
tail ~/.claude/mcp-*.log
```

**Fallback**: Comment out the offending server in `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`;
Claude falls back to built-in tools.

## Hook blocks legitimate action

**Symptom**: `permissionDecision: deny` when you expect allow.

**Causes**:
- Matcher regex too broad.
- Hook script returned non-zero unintentionally.
- Pattern match in `pre-bash-block-destructive.sh` overzealous.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Bypass once (review hook first!)
# Edit .claude/settings.json — comment out the matcher temporarily.

# Or fix the hook script:
vi .claude/hooks/pre-bash-block-destructive.sh
# Test:
bash -x .claude/hooks/pre-bash-block-destructive.sh "your-command"
```

**Anti-pattern**: Disabling all hooks. If a hook fires wrong, fix the rule;
don't remove enforcement.

## Hook timeout (>2s)

**Symptom**: Sluggish Claude Code; events not firing.

**Cause**: Hook does too much work (running full test suite, slow formatter).

**Fix**: Move long logic to a skill. Hooks should be `<2s` deterministic
checks only.

## CLAUDE.md grew past 200 lines

**Symptom**: `conjure audit` flags `HARD CAP exceeded`; Claude ignores rules.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Identify candidates to extract
conjure audit . | grep CLAUDE.md
# Move sections into skills:
#   mkdir -p .claude/skills/<topic>/
#   <move content>
#   Replace original section with: "For <topic>, see skills/<topic>/SKILL.md."
```

## Skill doesn't fire on expected request

**Symptom**: User asks something the skill should answer, Claude doesn't load it.

**Cause**: skill `description:` doesn't match user phrasing.

**Fix**: Rewrite description using the user's actual words:
- Bad: `"Database utilities."`
- Good: `"Postgres CSV bulk-import via psycopg2 — invoke when user asks to load CSV into Postgres."`

Then audit:
```bash
conjure audit
```

## Compaction lost critical rules

**Symptom**: After `/compact`, Claude no longer follows a rule.

**Cause**: Rule was buried at the bottom of CLAUDE.md (summarized first) OR
was given in conversation only (never saved to disk).

**Fix**:
- Move rule to TOP of CLAUDE.md (non-negotiables section).
- For conversation-only rules: promote to CLAUDE.md or a skill.

## graphify graph drifted from code

**Symptom**: Graph claims X exists but it's been refactored away.

**Cause**: Graph >7 days old AND >20 commits since build.

**Fix**:
```bash
conjure refresh-graph . --update     # incremental
# or full rebuild after large refactor
conjure refresh-graph . --full
```

The `session-start-context.sh` hook warns when graph is stale.

## Conjure update breaks something

**Symptom**: After `conjure update --apply`, a hook fails or skill loads wrong.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Backup is automatic
ls -la .claude.backup-*

# Roll back
rm -rf .claude
mv .claude.backup-<latest> .claude

# File issue with diagnostic info
conjure audit > audit.log
conjure version >> audit.log
```

## Multiple Claude sessions race-update `.claude/`

**Symptom**: Conflicting changes in `.claude/COMPOUND-CANDIDATES.md` or
backup proliferation.

**Cause**: No locking between sessions.

**Fix**: Coordinate via git — commit `.claude/` after major harness edits.
For team setups, `.claude/` should be version-controlled and reviewed.

## Hook script has wrong exit code

**Symptom**: Destructive action you intended to block proceeded.

**Cause**: Hook used `exit 1` (non-blocking) instead of `exit 2` (block).

**Fix**: Audit all hooks:
```bash
grep -nE '^exit 1$' .claude/hooks/*.sh
# Change to: exit 2
```

## "Conjure version mismatch" warnings

**Symptom**: `conjure update` reports project pinned to older version.

**Decision**:
- If you want the latest: `conjure update --apply` (review diff first).
- If you want to stay pinned: `echo "$VERSION" > .claude/.conjure-version`
  to silence warnings; document why in `.claude/EVENT-LOG.md`.

## Disaster recovery

Lost the entire `.claude/` directory mid-session:

```bash
# 1. Stop Claude Code.
# 2. Restore from most recent backup.
mv .claude.backup-<latest> .claude

# 3. Or, if no backup: scaffold fresh.
conjure init existing

# 4. Re-run discovery via PROMPT.md [EXISTING] invocation.
# 5. graphify graph survives separately at graphify-out/.
```
