## Active Milestone

**v0.5.0 — Auto-Update + Healthcheck**

Enable harnesses to stay current: detect drift from upstream, resolve conflicts interactively, and automate updates via PR. Closes the lifecycle loop opened in v0.4.0.

### v0.5.0 Auto-Update + Healthcheck (Phases 16-20)

- [ ] **Phase 20: Windows + CI Gate** - Ship `conjure.ps1` PowerShell shim and CI validation jobs

## Phase Details

### Phase 16: Prerequisites
**Goal**: Lay the two infrastructure foundations that every downstream phase requires — a dry-run-safe file deletion primitive and a clean positional argument interface for `publish-skill`
**Depends on**: Phase 15.1 (v0.4.0 complete)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, DEBT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `conjure publish-skill <name> <org/repo>` works with a positional second argument and no `TARGET_REPO` env required
  2. Using `TARGET_REPO` env still works but prints a `WARN:` deprecation message
  3. `mutate_rm <path>` exists in `lib/mutate.sh`, respects `DRY_RUN`, and increments `CONJURE_DRY_MUTATION_COUNT`
  4. Existing `mutate_cp` / `mutate_write` regression tests still pass; new `mutate_rm` regression test added
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Add mutate_rm to lib/mutate.sh + regression test (INFRA-01)
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md — publish-skill positional $2 refactor + SKILL-05 test (DEBT-02)

### Phase 17: Drift Detection
**Goal**: Users can discover whether their installed harness has drifted from the upstream kit snapshot via a single read-only command
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: DRIFT-01, DRIFT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `conjure check` prints a file-level delta report showing added, modified, and removed files relative to the upstream kit snapshot
  2. `conjure check` exits 0 when the harness is fully current and exits 1 when drift is detected
  3. `conjure check --porcelain` emits machine-readable lines consumable by scripts without text parsing
  4. A harness file with only user edits (not upstream changes) is not falsely reported as drifted
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — Create scripts/check.sh worker (sha256 classifier, manifest builder, M/R/A output)
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Wire cmd_check in cli/conjure + DRIFT regression tests in tests/run.sh

### Phase 18: Conflict Resolution
**Goal**: Users can interactively resolve all diff3 conflict sidecars left by `conjure update --apply` without manually editing files
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: RESOLVE-01, RESOLVE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `conjure resolve` walks through each `.conjure-conflict-*` sidecar file and prompts `[k]eep / [a]pply / [e]dit / [s]kip` per file
  2. Running `conjure resolve` in a non-interactive environment (piped stdin) exits 2 with a clear error message
  3. After a user confirms a resolution, the sidecar file is removed via `mutate_rm` (dry-run safe)
  4. When all sidecars are cleared, `conjure resolve` prints "No conflicts remain" and exits 0
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 19: Auto-PR
**Goal**: Users can automate harness-update PRs on demand or via a scheduled GitHub Action without manual git operations
**Depends on**: Phase 17, Phase 18
**Requirements**: AUTPR-01, AUTPR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `conjure update --pr` pushes a harness-update branch and opens a GitHub PR with the drift diff as the PR body
  2. Running `conjure update --pr` a second time when a PR already exists for the same branch prints the existing PR URL and exits 0 (idempotent)
  3. An optional `.github/workflows/conjure-update.yml` cron template is written by `conjure init` (or on demand) enabling automated weekly drift checks
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 20: Windows + CI Gate
**Goal**: Native Windows users can invoke `conjure` without Git Bash, and CI correctly rejects tagged releases that lack check-run evidence
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Requirements**: WIN-01, WIN-02, DEBT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `conjure.ps1` invokes the full `conjure` CLI on native Windows without requiring Git Bash or a manual PATH setup
  2. `conjure.ps1` propagates exit codes correctly — running `conjure.ps1 --version` in pwsh exits 0; a command that exits 2 propagates 2 to the caller
  3. CI matrix includes a `windows-latest` job with `shell: pwsh` that smoke-tests `conjure.ps1 --version` and asserts exit code propagation
  4. The `ci-gate` job in `release.yml` fails with an explicit error message when a tagged commit has zero GitHub check-runs, and includes a retry loop to handle API propagation lag
**Plans**: TBD
