# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-28)

**Core value:** A developer can turn any repo into a production-grade, eval-backed Claude Code harness with one trustworthy command — and keep it healthy over time.
**Current focus:** Phase 21 — foundation-libs-inventory

## Current Position

Phase: 21 (foundation-libs-inventory) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 4
Status: Executing Phase 21
Last activity: 2026-05-28 -- Phase 21 execution started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 55 (v0.3.0: 22, v0.4.0: 23, v0.5.0: 10)
- Average duration: — min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Key v0.6.0 design decisions:

- Split responsibility: CLI owns all filesystem mutations; restructure skill owns all LLM judgment
- Skill restricted to `[Read, Bash]` — cannot call `Write`/`Edit` on project files directly
- `snapshot_create` uses raw `cp -R`, NOT `mutate_cp` — snapshot is the safety primitive, not a mutation
- Build order is hard: log.sh → snapshot.sh → inventory.sh → adopt.sh → skill → tests

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 22 open question: step-id format (slug vs UUID) — decide during planning before coding `adopt.sh`
- Phase 22 open question: `--apply-step` / `--update-manifest` callback contract JSON schema validation depth
- Phase 23 open question: skill body must fit in ≤200 lines while covering manifest load, invariant check, plan proposal, approval loop, patch write, final audit — may need a planning spike
