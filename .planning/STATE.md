# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-26)

**Core value:** A developer can turn any repo into a production-grade, eval-backed Claude Code harness with one trustworthy command — and keep it healthy over time.
**Current focus:** v0.5.0 — Phase 16 ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 20 (Prerequisites)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-26 — Roadmap created for v0.5.0 (5 phases, 11 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v0.5.0 ordering]: Prerequisites (INFRA-01 + DEBT-02) first — unblock mutate_rm before any resolve script is written
- [v0.5.0 ordering]: Drift detection (Phase 17) before Auto-PR (Phase 19) — AUTPR-01 consumes --porcelain output
- [v0.5.0 ordering]: Conflict resolution (Phase 18) before Auto-PR (Phase 19) — complete user story: apply → resolve → PR
- [v0.4.0 Docker]: debian:bookworm-slim base; separate Homebrew tap repo
- [v0.4.0 release]: 4-job release.yml — ci-gate → release → docker + homebrew (parallel)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 17]: `check_file_drift` function design (3-way classification without running `git merge-file`) is design-intensive — prototype and test before implementation
- [Phase 19]: Integration between `lib/merge.sh merge_user_files` and the new branch/commit/push flow needs a concrete integration test before phase is marked complete
