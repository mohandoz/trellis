# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-24)

**Core value:** A developer can turn any repo into a production-grade, eval-backed Claude Code harness with one trustworthy command — and keep it healthy over time.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Pre-flight & Cross-Platform Hooks

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone scope]: v0.3.0 = Testing + telemetry; quality/trust precede distribution (v0.4.0 deferred)
- [Architecture]: All writes funnel through a single `lib/mutate.sh` chokepoint so dry-run is enforced once, not per call site
- [Telemetry]: Local-only, opt-in, PII-free by design; no-egress is an enforced CI test, not a promise

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 7]: Exact Claude Code skill-load hook event name/shape is unverified against installed CC ≥2.1.117 — must confirm at phase-research time; coarse `SessionStart`/`Stop` fallback required.
- [Phase 1/2]: Two live bugs in the working tree (`--dry-run` mutates disk; `templates/settings.json.tmpl` hardwires bash hooks, dead on native Windows) — front-loaded as Phases 1–2 because all downstream work depends on a trustworthy `init`.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Distribution | Marketplace / Homebrew / Docker / publish-skill (DIST-01..05) | Deferred to v0.4.0 | v0.3.0 scoping |
| Cost | Bundled offline Claude tokenizer | Out of scope (no accurate tokenizer) | v0.3.0 scoping |
| Testing | Full 9×4 profile×overlay fixture matrix | Out of scope (representative pairs only) | v0.3.0 scoping |

## Session Continuity
