# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-28)

**Core value:** A developer can turn any repo into a production-grade, eval-backed Claude Code harness with one trustworthy command — and keep it healthy over time.
**Current focus:** Phase 22 — conjure-adopt-cli-core-rollback

## Current Position

Phase: 22 (conjure-adopt-cli-core-rollback) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Key v0.6.0 design decisions:

- Split responsibility: CLI owns all filesystem mutations; restructure skill owns all LLM judgment
- Skill restricted to `[Read, Bash]` — cannot call `Write`/`Edit` on project files directly
- `snapshot_create` uses raw `cp -R`, NOT `mutate_cp` — snapshot is the safety primitive, not a mutation
- Build order is hard: log.sh → snapshot.sh → inventory.sh → adopt.sh → skill → tests
- [Phase ?]: Phase 22 Wave 0: graceful-red test block in tests/run.sh gates every later verification before scripts/adopt.sh exists
- [Phase ?]: _-prefixed fixture dirs are excluded from the generic tests/fixtures/[^_]*/ audit + golden-EXPECT loops
- [Phase ?]: SIGKILL recovery test asserts the non-TTY exit-2 + last-completed form; interactive prompt deferred to manual verification

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 22 open question: step-id format (slug vs UUID) — decide during planning before coding `adopt.sh`
- Phase 22 open question: `--apply-step` / `--update-manifest` callback contract JSON schema validation depth
- Phase 23 open question: skill body must fit in ≤200 lines while covering manifest load, invariant check, plan proposal, approval loop, patch write, final audit — may need a planning spike
