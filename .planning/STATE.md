# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-25)

**Core value:** A developer can turn any repo into a production-grade, eval-backed Claude Code harness with one trustworthy command — and keep it healthy over time.
**Current focus:** v0.4.0 milestone complete — all 9 phases done

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone v0.4.0 complete

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 15.1 inserted after Phase 15: Fix release.yml Docker+Homebrew coupling (URGENT)

### Decisions

- [v0.3.0 scope]: Quality/trust precede distribution; all writes through `lib/mutate.sh` chokepoint
- [v0.4.0 ordering]: Nyquist backfill first, then 3-way merge (deepest logic), then distribution channels
- [Docker base]: debian:bookworm-slim (not Alpine) to avoid musl libc breaks for optional Go/Rust tools
- [Homebrew]: Separate tap repo `mohandoz/homebrew-conjure`; formula pinned to tagged tarball SHA256 only
- [Phase ?]: Three new CI steps (version-consistency, claude CLI install, plugin validate) added to test job — MKTPL-02 and MKTPL-03 delivered
- [Phase ?]: Script-copy sandbox isolation for publish-plugin.sh regression tests — script self-resolves CONJURE_HOME, env override ignored

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 12]: Overlay version compatibility contract (`compatible-kit-version`) deferred to v0.4.x — define during OVLY implementation before first overlay ships in production
- [Phase 13]: Run `brew search conjure` before Phase 13 formula work to check for name collision; fallback names are `conjure-kit` or `conjure-claude`
- [Phase 09]: Non-git installs (Homebrew tarball) will not have `.conjure-templates-<version>/` unless snapshot is written at init time — must decide on snapshot strategy before merge implementation
